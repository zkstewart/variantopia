        Queries the NCLS structure to find Features that exist within the given
        start->stop range. Specifying the field and value will narrow results
        to only those that have a Feature .field with an equal (==) value.
        
        Parameters:
            start -- an integer indicating the start position of the feature to check
                     for overlaps
            end -- an integer indicating the end positon of the feature to check for
                   overlaps; this should be 1-based in GFF3 style e.g., a first
                   position of a feature would be start=1, end=1.
            field -- a string (case-sensitive) indicating the field of the Feature
                     object that we want to check. For example, if you want to find
                     features that overlap the given start->stop range on the contig
                     "X", you'd provide "contig" as the field so this function knows
                     to check the Feature.contig field for the value of "X".
            value -- a string (case-sensitive) indicating the value of the Feature
                     field we want to find. As in the above example, if you want to
                     find the value "X" within the .contig field, you'd provide "X" as
                     the value here.
        Returns:
            features -- a list containing Features that overlap the specified range.
                        These Features are NOT deepcopied, so handle them carefully.
